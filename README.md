# Cat Clicker Project
The Cat Clicker Project is one of the self-paced projects in the course “JavaScript Design Patterns” in _Udacity Nanodegree Program_.

## Repo Structure

This repo consists of several branches. Each branch represents some stage of the development of the project. Its evolution, if you like 😉.

## Framework

As a framework I used [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). That was my first experience with that tool. And you know what? #vuejs is awesome!
